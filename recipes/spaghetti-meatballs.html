<h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I have been making this spaghetti recipe, from a dear family friend, for over 25 years. It is by far the 
        best homemade sauce and meatballs we have ever had.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Sauce:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (29 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes </li>
                <li>19 fluid ounces tomato juice </li>
                <li>1 (5.5 ounce) can tomato paste </li>

            </ul>
        <h4>Meatballs:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ½ pounds lean ground beef </li>
                <li>16 soda crackers, crushed </li>
                <li>2 eggs, beaten </li>
                <li>3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese </li>

                <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti </li>
            </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine tomatoes, tomato juice, tomato paste, onion, parsley, salt, red pepper flakes, black pepper, thyme, and cloves in a large pot. 
            Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to low and let simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine beef, crackers, eggs, Parmesan cheese, garlic, parsley, and thyme in a bowl. 
            Form into large meatballs and place into a broiler pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and no 
            longer pink in the centers, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer meatballs to sauce and continue to simmer, 2 to 2 1/2 hours more.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Serve sauce and meatballs over cooked spaghetti.</li>
